Advanced Analysis of Raw Data

1. Raw Data shall be in Hexadecimal format, which has to be converted into decimal format.

2. The user shall be able to shift the string to left (by adding a 0 in front of the string) or to right (by removing the 0 in front of the string).

3. The string is exploded to get string values in pairs per position.

4. Each hexadecimal value at position is converted to decimal value.

5. The user is able to get the min, max and average value per position on the basis of 1000 rows picked from the csv file uploaded. He shall also be able to see a pattern emerging from the columns like if a column sees a regular increment or decrement of a value or constant value.

6. The user shall be able to create a hypothesis on the basis of the values retrieved from 5, whereby he can select a combination of positions to create a perceivable parameter like the lat/long or date, time etc.

7. The user shall be able to save this hypothesis and thereafter upload the csv to validate the hypothesis to get a value.

8. The user shall be able to export the results
